# Changelog

Versions are `MAJOR.PHASE.PATCH` — major is the architecture, phase tracks the
roadmap in the README, patch is everything since.

## 2.3.0

Version and commit shown in the header, so which build is running is readable
rather than inferred.

## 2.2.x — generation

- **Cost per run** ([#9](https://github.com/justinnewbold/fractal-ai-builder/pull/9)).
  Each run sends the full model roster plus every placed block's parameter
  schema, so input tokens scale with the preset.
- **Diagnostics panel** ([#8](https://github.com/justinnewbold/fractal-ai-builder/pull/8)).
  Shows what actually went on the wire. The device accepts an out-of-range
  write silently — it clamps and returns `ok` — so the response can't tell you
  whether a write landed.
- **Normalised writes** ([#7](https://github.com/justinnewbold/fractal-ai-builder/pull/7)).
  Reads return real units; writes take 0–1. Undocumented, and the reason every
  generated preset had been landing with its controls pinned at maximum.
  Includes log-scale handling for frequency controls.
- **`continuous: false`** ([#6](https://github.com/justinnewbold/fractal-ai-builder/pull/6)).
  A wrong fix for the above, kept because discrete writes get a rejection
  watch. Both write paths normalise; the flag was never the bug.
- **Gain staging off limits** ([#4](https://github.com/justinnewbold/fractal-ai-builder/pull/4)).
  Output levels read like tone controls by name, so they were being dialled
  like tone controls. Range checking can't catch it — −60 dB is legal.

## 2.1.0 — control ([#5](https://github.com/justinnewbold/fractal-ai-builder/pull/5))

Preset browser, rename, hand editing, change log, and write verification.

Verification was added to catch stale cache reads and has since caught two
bugs it wasn't built for. It stays.

## 2.0.0 — the rewrite ([#1](https://github.com/justinnewbold/fractal-ai-builder/pull/1), [#2](https://github.com/justinnewbold/fractal-ai-builder/pull/2), [#3](https://github.com/justinnewbold/fractal-ai-builder/pull/3))

Retired the Electron and Computer Use app — screenshots in, mouse clicks out —
and replaced it with a web app driving the hardware through the ForgeFX HTTP
API. Generation moved to the Vercel AI SDK.

## 1.x

Electron app driving FM3-Edit with Claude's Computer Use API. macOS only,
roughly a dollar a session, and it clicked in the wrong place on any display
that wasn't exactly 2560px wide.
